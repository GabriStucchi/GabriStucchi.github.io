# Loop Spicer  LOGO
##### A tool for spicing up your music: as simple as a loop station, as spicy as a whole band!

## How To Use
The loop spicer comes from the need of having a virtual band playing live together with you. Starting from a simple chord progression played on the keyboard it will reproduce and spice it up by adding more instruments and enriching the harmony in order to create an immersive experience bla bla

1. Select the tonality of your music
2. Select the bpm (?)
3. Start playing some simple chords, they will be looped and represent the basic harmony of your performance
4. Now you can start playing and improvising above the chosen chord progression with the synth sound you prefer
5. While playing you can choose to add or remove some instruments (bass, piano, drums) as well as changing their complexity
6. At the end, if you like the performance, it is possible to export it as wav??
